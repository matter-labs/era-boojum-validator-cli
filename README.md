# zkSync Era: Boojum verifier CLI

To run local test:


```shell
cargo test test_local_proof --  --nocapture
```

It tries the local proof with all the fixes, on 24 bit. 
Both proof and the vkey are in example_proofs/snark_wrapper

It also generates the test, that can be inserted in unittests for Verifier.sol.

# 
This is an experimental command line tool to verify the proofs for zkSync Era's updated proof system, Boojum [https://github.com/matter-labs/era-boojum](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-boojum).

The CLI fetches Boojum proofs for a given batch, public inputs, and aux input all from L1 and verifies the proof off chain. For testnet and sepolia chains, there may not be proofs submitted on chian for batches.

Learn more about the Boojum proof system in our blog post: [https://zksync.mirror.xyz/HJ2Pj45EJkRdt5Pau-ZXwkV2ctPx8qFL19STM5jdYhc](https://zksync.mirror.xyz/HJ2Pj45EJkRdt5Pau-ZXwkV2ctPx8qFL19STM5jdYhc)

# Proof generation limitation

We are currently generating boojum proofs for all batches on sepolia, so at the moment this is the only chain supported. For mainnet and testnet, these will be updated once supported.

# Running the CLI

You can verify that committed proofs are valid by running:

```shell
cargo run -- --batch <batch_number> --l1-rpc <your L1 rpc https endpoint>
```

Full example

```shell
cargo run -- --batch 109939 --network mainnet --l1-rpc https://rpc.ankr.com/eth
```

If you need to update the verification key to the latest, run with the corresponding flag.
```shell
cargo run -- --batch 109939 --network mainnet --l1-rpc https://rpc.ankr.com/eth --update-verification-key true
```

## CLI Options

```shell
--batch - The L1 batch number you want to verify the generated proof
--network - Along with batch number, defines if you want to verify a proof for Era testnet or mainnet. It defaults to mainnet. Accepts "mainnet" or "testnet"
--l1-rpc - The RPC url required to pull data from L1.
--update-verification-key - Specifes if the verification key should be updated from [github](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/tools/data/scheduler_key.json).
--json - Flag to specify if the output should be in json. Note that all the usual std out prints are silenced.
```

## Error Codes

Below is a list of the error codes that can be seen in the json output of the cli tool:
- 0 => `Success`
- 1 => `InvalidNetwork`
- 2 => `NoRPCProvided`
- 3 => `FailedToDeconstruct`
- 4 => `FailedToGetDataFromL1`
- 5 => `FailedToFindCommitTxn`
- 6 => `InvalidLog`
- 7 => `FailedToGetTransactionReceipt`
- 8 => `FailedToGetBatchCommitment`
- 9 => `ProofDoesntExist`
- 10 => `FailedToFindProveTxn`
- 11 => `InvalidTupleTypes`
- 12 => `FailedToCallRPC`
- 13 => `VerificationKeyHashMismatch`
- 14 => `FailedToDownloadVerificationKey`
- 15=> `FailedToWriteVerificationKeyToDisk`
- 16 => `ProofVerificationFailed`

# Future plans

Currently this CLI verification keys are hardcoded or pulled from github, but the plan is to extend this tool to:
* support all the 13 different circuits (and not only the 3 that are currently hardcoded)
* add more debugging / explanations

## More details
The proving process consists of three steps:

* Pull data from L1 including: proof, public input, aux input, and verification key hash
* Validates the verification key being used is in line with the one on L1.
* Checking if the 'proof' is correct.

The example output looks like this:

```


First, the CLI fetches the 'proof' from the calldata of `proveBatches` on L1. This proof is a `Proof` struct from the Boojum repository, which includes the configuration, public inputs, and additional data required for Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle (FRI), like oracle caps, values, and queries.



Other data we collect data from L1 includes:
* The hash of the previous block
* The hash of the current block
* The hash of the bootloader code
* The hash of the default account code
* BlockAuxilaryOutput:
    * The hash of the system logs
    * The hash of the state diffs
    * The hash of bootloader initial contents
    * The hash of the event queue
* And other metadata like queue hashes



Finally, we check that this proof is valid and matches a specific verification key, in this case, it's the `scheduler_key.json`. This key is like a fingerprint of the code of the circuit.

# Advanced options

## Snark proof verification

Currently we are planning to wrap the final FRI proof, into a SNARK (to lower the size of the proof and cost of verification in L1).

To verify that the wrapper is correct, you can use the ``verify-snark-wrapper`` command. 

WARNING: This verifier is still WIP, so command arguments will change.

```shell
cargo run  -- verify-snark-wrapper example_proofs/snark_wrapper/l1_batch_proof_1.bin example_proofs/snark_wrapper/snark_verification_scheduler_key.json
```

You can also generate the solidity test for Verifier.sol, by running:

```shell
cargo run -- generate-solidity-test example_proofs/snark_wrapper/l1_batch_proof_1.bin
```

There is also a larger test inside, that computes the public inputs hash:

```shell
cargo test test_local_proof --  --nocapture
```
